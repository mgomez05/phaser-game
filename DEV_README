---------------------Phaser Notes------------------------
Snippets
    -Code to add a star at the center of the screen
        this.add.image(game_width / 2, game_height / 2, 'star')

General Notes
    -Phaser images are layered in the order that they are added
    -Physics bodies (there are two types)
        -dynamic: 
            -Can move around via forces of acceleration or velocity,
            -Can bounce and collide with other objects
            -Collisions are influenced by the mass of the body and other elements
        -static:
            -Just has a position and a size
            -Isn't touched by gravity
            -You can't set velocity on it
            -When something collides with it, it doesn't move
    -Groups
        -Allow you to group together similar objects and control them as a signel unit
        -Can check for collision between a Group and other game objects
        -Capable of creating their own Game Objects via create() and other functions
        
    -Physics Groups
        -Automatically create physics enabled children
